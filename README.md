# School District Analysis with Pandas

## Background
As the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you have been assigned the task of analyzing district-wide standardized test results. You have been provided with access to math and reading scores for every student, along with various information about the schools they attend. Your goal is to aggregate the data and identify trends in school performance to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future budgets and priorities.

## Repository Setup
To set up the project repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository named "pandas-challenge" specifically for this project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Inside the local Git repository, create a folder named "PyCitySchools" for this assignment.
4. Add your Jupyter Notebook file to the "PyCitySchools" folder. This notebook will serve as the main script for analysis.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub or GitLab.

## Instructions
Using the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report should also include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

## District Summary
Perform calculations to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics. Create a DataFrame with the following information:

* Total number of unique schools
* Total number of students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students passing math
* Percentage of students passing reading
* Overall passing rate (percentage of students passing both math and reading)

## School Summary
Perform calculations to create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics for each school. Include the following information:

* School name
* School type
* Total number of students
* Total school budget
* Budget per student
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students passing math
* Percentage of students passing reading
* Overall passing rate (percentage of students passing both math and reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by the overall passing rate in descending order and display the top 5 performing schools in a DataFrame.

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by the overall passing rate in ascending order and display the bottom 5 performing schools in a DataFrame.

## Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. Use the provided bins and labels to group schools.

Calculate the following metrics for each spending range:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students passing math
* Percentage of students passing reading
* Overall passing rate (percentage of students passing both math and reading)

## Scores by School Size
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size. Use the provided bins and labels to group schools.

Calculate the following metrics for each school size range:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students passing math
* Percentage of students passing reading
* Overall passing rate (percentage of students passing both math and reading)

## Scores by School Type
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (charter vs. district).

Calculate the following metrics for each school type:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students passing math
* Percentage of students passing reading
* Overall passing rate (percentage of students passing both math and reading)

## Observable Trends
Provide a written description of at least two observable trends based on the analysis of the school district data.
